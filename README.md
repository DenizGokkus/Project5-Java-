Matrix Search in Java

This Java program demonstrates a simple search operation within a 3x3 matrix. It prompts the user to input a value and searches for this value within a predefined matrix. If the value is found, it prints the location within the matrix; otherwise, it informs the user that the value is not found.

Features
Simple Matrix Setup: Uses a static 3x3 matrix populated with integers.
User Interaction: Allows the user to enter the search value.
Immediate Feedback: Provides immediate feedback on whether and where the value was found in the matrix
